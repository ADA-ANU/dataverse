In the next release another constraint is being added to existing
databases, to prevent any possibility of creating datafile objects
referencing the same file. This was originally planned for v4.20, but
in that release the constraint was only added to newly created
databases, and was not forced on the databases that had already
existed. If your current database was originally created by version
4.20 or newer, you don't need to do anything.

If you have an older database, please run the following script: 

https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/raw/develop/scripts/issues/7451/check_datafiles_7451.sh

The script relies on the PostgreSQL utility psql to access the
database. You will need to edit the credentials at the top of the script
to match your database configuration.

The script will check your database for any duplicated storage
identifiers that would violate the new constraint. It will resolve any
such conflicts found in harvested files; but for any duplicated local
files, it will not attempt to make any changes right away (this being
an issue of data integrity with a potential to affect your users).
The script would then instruct you to send the produced diagnostic
information to support@dataverse.org so that we could assist you in
resolving the issues in your database. If no inconsistencies are
found, the script will report that the database is ready to be
upgraded to the next release.

Please note that there's a very good chance that your database does
not have any conflicts of this nature. But we want to do this to be
absolutely sure. We apologize for any inconvenience.
