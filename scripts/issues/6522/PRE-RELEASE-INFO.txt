In the next Dataverse release, we are adding a database constraint to
prevent duplicate DataFile objects pointing to the same physical file
from being created.

Before the next release can be deployed, we need to check your
database for any such duplicates that may already exist. If present,
the duplicates will need to be deleted, and the stored files checked
for potential corruption.

Please run the diagnostic script provided at
https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/raw/6522-duplicate-dvobjects/scripts/issues/6522/find_duplicates.sh.
The script relies on PostgreSQL utility psql in order to talk to the
database. You'll need to edit the credentials at the top of the script
to match your setup.

If this issue is not present in your database, you will see a message
"... no duplicate dvObjects in your database. Your installation is
ready to be upgraded to Dataverse 4.20"

If duplicates are detected, it will provide further instructions. We
will need you to send us the produced output. We will then assist you
in resolving this problem in your database.
