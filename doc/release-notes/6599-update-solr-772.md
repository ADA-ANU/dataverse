With this release we upgrade to the latest available stable release in the
Solr 7.x branch. We encourage you to upgrade. See also
[upstream docs](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_7/upgrading-a-solr-cluster.html)
for detailed instructions how to update.

*might be included*
We fixed the schema including some deprecated field types. You should do
a reindex of your data to be safe.
