A Dataverse installation can be configured to allow out of band upload by setting the ``dataverse.files.\<id\>.upload-out-of-band`` JVM option to ``true``.
By default, Dataverse supports uploading files via the :ref:`add-file-api`. With S3 stores, a direct upload process can be enabled to allow sending the file directly to the S3 store (without any intermediate copies on the Dataverse server).
With the upload-out-of-band option enabled, it is also possible for file upload to be managed manually or via third-party tools, with the :ref:`Adding the Uploaded file to the Dataset <direct-add-to-dataset-api>` API call (described in the :doc:`/developers/s3-direct-upload-api` page) used to add metadata and inform Dataverse that a new file has been added to the relevant store.
