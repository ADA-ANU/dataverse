# Dataverse 5.4

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to Dataverse. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Search with non-ascii characters

Many languages include characters that have close analogs in ascii, e.g. (á, à, â, ç, é, è, ê, ë, í, ó, ö, ú, ù, û, ü…). This release changes the default Solr configuration to allow search to match words based on these associations, e.g. a search for Mercè would match the word Merce in a Dataset, and vice versa. This should generally be helpful, but can result in false positives.,e.g. "canon" will be found searching for "cañon".

### Deactivate Users API, Get User Traces API, Revoke Roles API

A new API has been added to deactivate users to prevent them from logging in or otherwise being active in the system. Deactivating a user is an alternative to deleting a user, especially when the latter is not possible due to the amount of interaction the user has had with the system. In order to learn more about a user before deleting, deactivating, or merging, a new "get user traces" API is available that will show objects created, roles, group memberships, and more. Finally, the "remove all roles" button available in the superuser dashboard is now also available via API.

### New File Access API

A new api offers *crawlable* access view of the folders and files within a datset:

```
  /api/datasets/<dataset id>/dirindex/
```

will output a simple html listing, based on the standard Apache
directory index, with Access API download links for individual files,
and recursive calls to the API above for sub-folders. (See the
documentation entry in the guides for more information).

Using this API, ``wget --recursive`` (or similar crawling client) can
be used to download all the files in a dataset, preserving the file
names and folder structure; without having to use the download-as-zip
API. In addition to being faster (zipping is a relatively
resource-intensive operation on the server side), this process can be
restarted if interrupted (with ``wget --continue`` or equivalent) -
unlike zipped multi-file downloads that always have to start from the
beginning.

On a system that uses S3 with download redirects, the individual file
downloads will be handled by S3 directly, without having to be proxied
through the Dataverse application.

### Java 11

The Dataverse software now runs and requires Java 11. This will provide performance and security enhancements, allows developers to take advantage of new and updated Java features, and moves the project to a platform with better longer term support. This upgrade requires a few extra steps in the release process, outlined below.

## Major Use Cases

Newly-supported use cases in this release include:

- Deactivate Users (Issue #xxx, PR #xxx)
- Non-ascii characters

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Java 11 Upgrade

There are some things to note and keep in mind regarding the move to Java 11:

- You should install the JDK/JRE following your usual methods, depending on your operating system. An example of this on a RHEL/CentOS 7 or RHEL/CentOS 8 system is:

    `$ sudo yum remove java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless`  

    `$ sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel`  
    
    The `remove` command may provide an error message if -headless isn't installed.

- We targeted and tested Java 11, but 11+ will likely work. Java 11 was targeted because of its long term support.
- If you're moving from a Dataverse installation that was previously running Glassfish 4.x (typically this would be Dataverse Software 4.x), you will need to adjust some JVM options in domain.xml as part of the upgrade process. We've provided these optional steps below. These steps are not required if your first installed Dataverse version was running Payara 5.x (typically Dataverse Software 5.x).

### New JVM and DB Options

#### New JVM Options

For installations that were previously running on Dataverse Software 4.x, the following JVM Options have been added in support of Java 11:

- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.loader=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.jrt=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.jar=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.naming/javax.naming.spi=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.rmi/sun.rmi.transport=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`
- `<jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>`

## Notes for Tool Developers and Integrators

### UTF-8 Characters and Spaces in File Names

UTF-8 characters in filenames are now preserved when downloaded.

Dataverse Installations will no longer replace spaces in file names of downloaded files with the + character. If your tool or integration has any special handling around this, you may need to make further adjustments to maintain backwards compatibility while also supporting Dataverse installations on 5.4+.

Note that this follows a change from 5.1 that only corrected this for installations running with S3 storage. This makes the behavior consistent across installations running all types of file storage.
