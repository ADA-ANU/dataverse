# Dataverse Software 5.12

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the Dataverse Software. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Harvard Data Commons Additions

As reported at the 2022 Dataverse Community Meeting, the [Harvard Data Commons](https://sites.harvard.edu/harvard-data-commons/) project has supported a wide range of additions to the Dataverse software that improve support for Big Data, Workflows, Archiving, and interaction with other repositories. In many cases, these additions build upon features developed within the Dataverse community by Borealis, DANS, QDR, TDL, and others. Highlights from this work include:

- Initial support for Globus file transfer to upload to and download from a Dataverse managed S3 store. The current implementation disables file restriction and embargo on Globus-enabled stores.
- Initial support for Remote File Storage. This capability, enabled via a new RemoteOverlay store type, allows a file stored in a remote system to be added to a dataset (currently only via API) with download requests redirected to the remote system. Use cases include referencing public files hosted on external web servers as well as support for controlled access managed by Dataverse (e.g. via restricted and embargoed status) and/or by the remote store.
- Initial support for computational workflows, including a new metadata block and detected filetypes.
- Support for archiving to any S3 store using Dataverse's RDA-conformant BagIT file format (a BagPack).
- Improved error handling and performance in archival bag creation and new options such as only supporting archiving of one dataset version.
- Additions/corrections to the OAI-ORE metadata format (which is included in archival bags) such as referencing the name/mimetype/size/checksum/download URL of the original file for ingested files, the inclusion of metadata about the parent collection(s) of an archived dataset version, and use of the URL form of PIDs.
- Display of archival status within the dataset page versions table, richer status options including success, pending, and failure states, with a complete API for managing archival status.
- Support for batch archiving via API as an alternative to the current options of configuring archiving upon publication or archiving each dataset version manually.
- Initial support for sending and receiving Linked Data Notification messages indicating relationships between a dataset and external resources (e.g. papers or other dataset) that can be used to trigger additional actions, such as the creation of a back-link to provide, for example, bi-directional linking between a published paper and a Dataverse dataset.
- A new capability to provide custom per field instructions in dataset templates
- Additional workflow file extensions are now detected.

### Update to Payara 5.2022.3 highly recommended

With lots of bug and security fixes included, we encourage everyone to update to Payara 5.2022.3 as soon as possible.

### Improvements to fields that appear in the Citation metadata block

Grammar, style and consistency improvements have been made to the titles, tooltip description text, and watermarks of metadata fields that appear in the Citation metadata block.

This includes fields that dataset depositors can edit in the Citation Metadata accordion (i.e. fields controlled by the citation.tsv and citation.properties files) and fields whose values are system-generated, such as the Dataset Persistent ID, Previous Dataset Persistent ID, and Publication Date fields whose titles and tooltips are configured in the bundles.properties file.

The changes should provide clearer information to curators, depositors, and people looking for data about what the fields are for.

A new page in the Style Guides called "Text" has also been added. The new page includes a section called "Metadata Text Guidelines" with a link to a Google Doc where the guidelines are being maintained for now since we expect them to be revised frequently.

### Adding new static search facet: Metadata Types
A new static search facet has been added to the search side panel. This new facet is called "Metadata Types" and is driven from metadata blocks. When a metadata field value is inserted into a dataset, an entry for the metadata block it belongs to is added to this new facet.

This new facet needs to be configured for it to appear on the search side panel. The configuration assigns to a dataverse what metadata blocks to show. The configuration is inherited by child dataverses.

To configure the new facet, use the Metadata Block Facet API: <https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/native-api.html#set-metadata-block-facet-for-a-dataverse-collection>

### Broader MicroProfile Config Support for Developers

As of this release, many [JVM options](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#jvm-options)
can be set using any [MicroProfile Config Source](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/Technical%20Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Overview.html#config-sources).

Currently this change is only relevant to developers but as settings are migrated to the new "lookup" pattern documented in the [Consuming Configuration](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/configuration.html) section of the Developer Guide, anyone installing the Dataverse software will have much greater flexibility when configuring those settings, especially within containers. These changes will be announced in future releases.

Please note that an upgrade to Payara 5.2021.8 or higher is required to make use of this. Payara 5.2021.5 threw exceptions, as explained in PR #8823.

## Major Use Cases and Infrastructure Enhancements

Changes and fixes in this release include:

- Administrators can configure an S3 store used in Dataverse to support users uploading/downloading files via Globus File Transfer. (PR #8891)
- Administrators can configure a RemoteOverlay store to allow files that remain hosted by a remote system to be added to a dataset. (PR #7325)
- Administrators can configure the Dataverse software to send archival Bag copies of published dataset versions to any S3-compatible service. (PR #8751)
- Users can see information about a dataset's parent collection(s) in the OAI-ORE metadata export. (PR #8770)
- Users and administrators can now use the OAI-ORE metadata export to retrieve and assess the fixity of the original file (for ingested tabular files) via the included checksum. (PR #8901)
- Archiving via RDA-conformant Bags is more robust and is more configurable. (PR #8773, #8747, #8699, #8609, #8606, #8610)
- Users and administrators can see the archival status of the versions of the datasets they manage in the dataset page version table. (PR #8748, #8696)
- Administrators can configure messaging between their Dataverse installation and other repositories that may hold related resources or services interested in activity within that installation. (PR #8775)
- Collection managers can create templates that include custom instructions on how to fill out specific metadata fields.
- Dataset update API users are given more information when the dataset they are updating is out of compliance with Terms of Access requirements (Issue #8859) 
- Adds a new setting (:ControlledVocabularyCustomJavaScript) that allows a JavaScript file to be loaded into the dataset page for the purpose of showing controlled vocabulary as a list (Issue #8722)
- Fixes an issue with the Redetect File Type API (Issue #7527)
- Updates the Import Dataset DDI API to allow the import of Terms of Use (Issue #8715)
- Optimizes some code to improve application memory usage (Issue #8871)
- Fixes sample data to reflect custom licenses.
- Fixes the Archival Status Input API (available to superusers) (Issue #8924)
- Small bugs have been fixed in the dataset export in the JSON and DDI formats; eliminating the export of "undefined" as a metadata language in the former, and a duplicate keyword tag in the latter. (Issue #8868)

## New DB Settings
The following DB settings have been added:
- `:ShibAffiliationOrder`  - Select the first or last entry in an Affiliation array
- `:ShibAffiliationSeparator` (default: ";") - Set the separator for the Affiliation array

## Installation

Please also contact us to get added to the [Dataverse Project Map](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.10/installation/config.html#putting-your-dataverse-installation-on-the-map-at-dataverse-org) if you have not done so already.

## Upgrade Instructions

0\. These instructions assume that you've already successfully upgraded from Dataverse Software 4.x to Dataverse Software 5 following the instructions in the [Dataverse Software 5 Release Notes](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.0). After upgrading from the 4.x series to 5.0, you should progress through the other 5.x releases before attempting the upgrade to 5.10.

If you are running Payara as a non-root user (and you should be!), **remember not to execute the commands below as root**. Use `sudo` to change to that user first. For example, `sudo -i -u dataverse` if `dataverse` is your dedicated application user.  

In the following commands we assume that Payara 5 is installed in `/usr/local/payara5`. If not, adjust as needed.


# Update to Payara 5.2022.3 highly recommended

With lots of bug and security fixes included, we encourage everyone to update to Payara 5.2022.3 as soon as possible.

**Note:** with the approaching EOL for the Payara 5 Community release train it's likely we will switch to a
yet-to-be-released Payara 6 in the not-so-far-away future.

We recommend you ensure you followed all update instructions from the past releases regarding Payara.
(latest Payara update was for [v5.6](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.6))

Upgrading requires a maintenance window and downtime. Please plan ahead, create backups of your database, etc.

The steps below are a simple matter of reusing your existing domain directory with the new distribution.
But we also recommend that you review the Payara upgrade instructions as it could be helpful during any troubleshooting:
[Payara Release Notes](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/Release%20Notes/Release%20Notes%205.2022.3.html)


Please note that the deletion of the `lib/databases` directory below is only required once, for this upgrade (see Issue #8230 for details).

```shell
export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara5
```

(or `setenv PAYARA /usr/local/payara5` if you are using a `csh`-like shell)

1\. Undeploy the previous version

```shell
    $PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications
    $PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse<-version>
```

2\. Stop Payara

```shell
    service payara stop
    rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated
    rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/osgi-cache
    rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/databases
```

3\. Move the current Payara directory out of the way

```shell
    mv $PAYARA $PAYARA.MOVED
```

4\. Download the new Payara version (5.2022.3), and unzip it in its place

5\. Replace the brand new payara/glassfish/domains/domain1 with your old, preserved domain1

6\. Start Payara

```shell
    service payara start
```

7\. Deploy this version.

```shell
    $PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.12.war
```

8\. Restart payara

```shell
    service payara stop
    service payara start
```
### Additional Upgrade Steps

Update the Citation metadata block:

- `wget https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/download/v#.##/citation.tsv`
- `curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -X POST --data-binary @citation.tsv -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values"`

- Re-export metadata files (OAI_ORE is affected by the PRs in these release notes). Optionally, for those using the Dataverse software's BagIt-based archiving, re-archive dataset versions archived using prior versions of the Dataverse software. This will be recommended/required in a future release.

- Run ReExportall to update Exports
