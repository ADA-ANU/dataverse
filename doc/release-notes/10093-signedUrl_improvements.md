A new version of the standard Dataverse Previewers from https://github/com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers is available. The new version supports the use of signedUrls rather than API keys when previewing restricted files (including files in draft dataset versions). Upgrading is highly recommended.

SignedUrls can now be used with PrivateUrl access, i.e. allowing PrivateUrl users to view Previews when they are configured to use signedUrls

Launching a Dataset-level Configuration tool will automatically generate an api key when needed. This is consistent with how other types of tools work.
