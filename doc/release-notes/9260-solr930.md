Solr has been upgraded to Solr 9. You must install Solr fresh and reindex. 

If you have custom metadata blocks installed, you must update your Solr schema.xml to include your custom fields. Please see https://guides.dataverse.org/en/9260-solr930/admin/metadatacustomization.html#updating-the-solr-schema
