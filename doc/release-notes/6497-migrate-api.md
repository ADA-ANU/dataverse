# Release Highlights

### Dataset Migration API (Experimental)

Datasets can now imported/updated following the format of an OAI-ORE export (RDA-conformant Bags), allowing for not only easier migration from one Dataverse installation to another, but also for better support of import from other systems. This experimental endpoint also allows keeping the existing persistent identifier and publication dates.

This development was supported by the [Research Data Alliance](https://re-alliance.org) and follows the recommendations from the [Research Data Repository Interoperability Working Group](http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00025).
