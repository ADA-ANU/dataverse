Developers can experiment with running Dataverse in Docker: https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/container/app-image.html

This is an image developers build locally. It is not meant for production use!

To provide a complete container-based local development environment, developers can deploy a Dataverse container from the new image in addition to other containers for the necessary dependencies: https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/container/dev-usage.html
