# Dataverse Software 5.5

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the Dataverse Software. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Auxiliary Files Accessible Through the UI

Auxiliary Files can now be downloaded from the web interface. Auxiliary files uploaded as type=DP appear under "Differentially Private Statistics" under file level download. The rest appear under "Other Auxiliary Files".

Please note that the auxiliary files feature is experimental and is designed to support integration with tools from the [OpenDP Project](https://opendp.org). If the API endpoints are not needed they can be blocked.

### Improved Workflow for Downloading Large Zip Files

Users trying to download a zip file larger than the Dataverse installation's :zipdownloadlimit will now receive messaging that the zip file is too large, and the user will be presented with alternate access options. Previously, the zip file would download and files above the :zipdownloadlimit would be excluded and noted in a manifest.txt file.

### New Metrics API

Users can retrieve new types of metrics and per-collection metrics. The new capabilities are described in the guides. A new version of the [Dataverse Metrics web app](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-metrics) adds interactive graphs to display these metrics. Anyone running the existing Dataverse Metrics app will need to upgrade or apply [a small patch](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-metrics/pull/60) to continue retrieving metrics from Dataverse instances upgrading to this release. Issue #7177/PR #7178

## Major Use Cases

Newly-supported major use cases in this release include:

- Sort Users. (Issue #xxx, PR #xxx)
- New Metrics API
- Aux Files
- New Download Workflow

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Zip Limit for installations running the external zipper

If your installation is running the experimental zipper service, note that the zipper service ignores the :zipdownload limit. If you'd like users to still download large zips, this should be set to an appropriate value.

### Geospatial Metadata Block Updated

The Geospatial metadata block (geospatial.tsv) was updated. Dataverse collection administrators can now add a search facet on their collection pages for the metadata block's "Other" field, so that people searching in their collections can narrow searches using the values entered in that field.

### Extended support for S3 Download Redirects ("Direct Downloads")

If your installation uses S3 for storage and you have "direct downloads" enabled, please note that it will now cover the following download types that were not handled by redirects in the earlier versions: saved originals of tabular data files, cached RData frames, resized thumbnails for image files and other auxiliary files. In other words, all the forms of the file download API that take extra arguments, such as "format" or "imageThumb" - for example:

`/api/access/datafile/12345?format=original`

`/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:1234/ABCDE/FGHIJ&imageThumb=true`

etc., that were previously excluded.

Since browsers follow redirects automatically, this change should not in any way affect the web GUI users. However, some API users may experience problems, if they use it in a way that does not expect to receive a redirect response. For example, if a user has a script where they expect to download a saved original of an ingested tabular file with the following command:

`curl https://yourhost.edu/api/access/datafile/12345?format=original > orig.dta`

it will fail to save the file when it receives a 303 (redirect) response instead of 200. So they will need to add "-L" to the command line above, to instruct curl to follow redirects:

`curl -L https://yourhost.edu/api/access/datafile/12345?format=original > orig.dta`

Most of your API users have likely figured it out already, since you enabled S3 redirects for "straightforward" downloads in your installation. But we feel it was worth a heads up, just in case.

### Authenticated User Deactivated Field Updated

The "deactivated" field on the Authenticated User table has been updated to be a non-nullable field. When the field was added in version 5.3 it was set to 'false' in an update script. If for whatever reason that update failed in the 5.3 deploy you will need to re-run it before deploying 5.5. The update query you may need to run is: UPDATE authenticateduser SET deactivated = false WHERE deactivated IS NULL;

## New JVM Options and Database Settings

## Notes for Tool Developers and Integrators

### S3 Download Redirects

See above note about download redirects. If your application integrates with the Dataverse using the APIs, you may need to change how redirects are handled in your tool or integration.

2\. Stop Payara and remove the generated directory

- `service payara stop`
- `rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`

3\. Start Payara

- `service payara start`
  
4\. Deploy this version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.5.war`

8\. Restart payara
