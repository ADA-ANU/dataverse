# Dataverse Software 5.8

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the Dataverse Software. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Support for Data Embargoes

Dataverse now supports file-level embargoes. The ability to set embargoes, up to a maximum duration (in months) can be configured by a Dataverse installation administrator.

- Users can configure a specific embargo, defined by an end date and a short reason, on a set of selected files or an individual file, by selecting the 'Embargo' menu item and entering information in a popup dialog. Embargoes can only be set, changed, or removed before a file has been published. After publication, only Dataverse installation administrators can make changes, using an API.

- While embargoed, files cannot be previewed or downloaded (as if restricted, with no option to allow access requests). After the embargo expires, files become accessible. If the files were also restricted, they remain inaccessible and functionality is the same as for any restricted file.

- By default, the citation date reported for the dataset and the datafiles in version 1.0 reflect the longest embargo period on any file in version 1.0, which is consistent with recommended practice from DataCite. Administrators can still specify an alternate date field to be used in the citation date via the [Set Citation Date Field Type for a Dataset API Call](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.8/api/native-api.html#set-citation-date-field-type-for-a-dataset)

The work to add this functionality was initiated by Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW), the Netherlands. It was further developed by the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) in cooperation with and with funding from DANS.

## Major Use Cases

Newly-supported major use cases in this release include:

- Users can set file-level embargoes. (Issue #7743, #4052, #343, PR #8020)

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Embargoes Prior to 5.8

There may datasets in your installation that have used previously-existing functionality to put embargoes in place. You may consider reaching out to those datasets and using the new feature to put an embargo in place.

## New JVM Options and DB Settings

- :MaxEmbargoDurationInMonths controls whether embargoes are allowed in a Dataverse instance and can limit the maximum duration users are allowed to specify. A value of 0 months or non-existent setting indicates embargoes are not supported. A value of -1 allows embargoes of any length.

## Installation

If this is a new installation, please see our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.8/installation/).

## Upgrade Instructions

0\. These instructions assume that you've already successfully upgraded from Dataverse Software 4.x to Dataverse Software 5 following the instructions in the [Dataverse Software 5 Release Notes](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.0). After upgrading from the 4.x series to 5.0, you should progress through the other 5.x releases before attempting the upgrade to 5.8.

If you are running Payara as a non-root user (and you should be!), **remember not to execute the commands below as root**. Use `sudo` to change to that user first. For example, `sudo -i -u dataverse` if `dataverse` is your dedicated application user.  

In the following commands we assume that Payara 5 is installed in `/usr/local/payara5`. If not, adjust as needed.

`export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara5`

(or `setenv PAYARA /usr/local/payara5` if you are using a `csh`-like shell)

1\. Undeploy the previous version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications`
- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse<-version>`

2\. Stop Payara and remove the generated directory

- `service payara stop`
- `rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`

3\. Start Payara

- `service payara start`
  
4\. Deploy this version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.8.war`

5\. Restart payara

- `service payara stop`
- `service payara start`
