### Support for external curation processes

Dataverse can now be configured, via the :AllowedCurationLabels setting, to support arbitrary short labels (e.g. "Author contacted", "Privacy Review", "Awaiting paper publication") on draft datasets that indicate the status/state of the dataset with respect to some externally defined curation process. Anyone who can publish the dataset (e.g. curators) can set/change/remove labels from the defined set via the user interface or via an API. The API also would allow external tools to search for, read and set labels on Datasets, providing an integration mechanism. Labels are visible on the Dataset page and in Dataverse collection listings/search results. Internally, the labels have no effect, and at publication, any existing label will be removed.
