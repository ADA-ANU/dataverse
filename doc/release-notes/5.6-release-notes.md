# Dataverse Software 5.6

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the Dataverse Software. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Anonymized Accesses in Support of Double Blind Review

### Guestbooks API



### Dataset Semantic API (Experimental)

Dataset metadata can be retrieved/set/updated using a new, flatter JSON-LD format - following the format of an OAI-ORE export (RDA-conformant Bags), allowing for easier transfer of metadata to/from other systems (i.e. without needing to know Dataverse's metadata block and field storage architecture). This new API also allows for the update of terms metadata (#5899).

This development was supported by the [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org), DANS, and Sciences PO and follows the recommendations from the [Research Data Repository Interoperability Working Group](http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00025).

### Direct Upload API Now Available for Adding Multiple Files Metadata to the Dataset

Users can now add metadata of multiple files to the dataset once the files exists in the s3 bucket using the direct upload API. 
For more information, see the [Direct DataFile Upload/Replace API section](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.6/developers/s3-direct-upload-api.html) of the Dataverse Software Guides.


## Major Use Cases

Newly-supported major use cases in this release include:

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Payara 5.2021.4 (or Higher) Required

Some changes in this release require an upgrade to Payara 5.2021.4 or higher.

Instructions on how to update can be found in the
[Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2021.4/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)

It would likely be safer to upgrade Payara first, while still running Dataverse 5.6, and then proceed with the steps
below. Upgrading from an earlier version of Payara should be a straightforward process: 

1. Undeploy Dataverse
2. Stop Payara
3. Move the current Payara directory out of the way
4. Unzip the new Payara version in its place
5. Replace the brand new payara/glassfish/domains/domain1 with your old, preserved `domain1`
6. Start Payara, deploy Dataverse 5.6.
   
We still recommend that you read the detailed upgrade instructions above and if you run into any issues with this
upgrade, it will help to be able to separate them from any problems with the upgrade of Dataverse proper.

### Enhancement to DDI Metadata Exports

Several changes have been made to the DDI exports to improve support for internationalization and to improve compliance with CESSDA requirements. These changes include:

* Addition of a holdings element with a URI attribute whose value is the URL form of the dataset PID

## Installation

If this is a new installation, please see our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.6/installation/).

## Upgrade Instructions

0\. These instructions assume that you've already successfully upgraded from Dataverse Software 4.x to Dataverse Software 5 following the instructions in the [Dataverse Software 5 Release Notes](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.0). After upgrading from the 4.x series to 5.0, you should progress through the other 5.x releases before attempting the upgrade to 5.6.

1\. Undeploy the previous version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications`
- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse<-version>`

2\. Stop Payara and remove the generated directory

- `service payara stop`
- `rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`

3\. Start Payara

- `service payara start`
  
4\. Deploy this version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.6.war`

5\. Restart payara

- `service payara stop`
- `service payara start`

## Additional Release Steps

**If your installation relies on the database-side stored procedure for generating sequential numeric identifiers:**

*(Note: You can skip the following paragraph if your installation uses the default-style, randomly-generated six alphanumeric 
character-long identifiers for your datasets!)*

The underlying database framework has been modified in this release, to make it easier for installations 
to create custom procedures for generating identifier strings that suit their needs. Your current configuration will 
be automatically updated by the database upgrade (Flyway) script incorporated in the release. No manual configuration 
changes should be necessary. However, after the upgrade, we recommend that you confirm that your installation can still 
create new datasets, and that they are still assigned sequential numeric identifiers. In the unlikely chance that this 
is no longer working, please re-create the stored procedure following the steps described in the documentation for the 
`:IdentifierGenerationStyle` setting in the *Configuration* section of the Installation Guide for this release (v5.6). 
(Running the script supplied there will NOT overwrite the position on the sequence you are currently using!)
