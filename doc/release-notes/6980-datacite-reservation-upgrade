##Dataverse installatins using Datacite: upgrade action required.

For Dataverses using Datacite v5.0 changes the process of registering the Global Identifier (DOI) for the dataset. Instead of registering it the first time the dataset is published, Dataverse will try to "reserve" the DOI when it's created (by registering it as a "draft", using Datacite terminology). When the user publishes the dataset, the DOI will be publicized as well (by switching the registration status to "findable"). 

This approach makes the process of publishing datasets simpler and less error-prone. One drawback is that a dataset cannot be published until the DOI is reserved. Specifically, if your installation uses Datacite, the moment it is upgraded to v5.0, all the pre-existing unpublished drafts will become "unpublishable", until the DOIs are reserved. So it is important to do that immediately after the upgrade, by using the following APIs:

`/api/pids/unreserved`  will report the ids of the datasets 
`/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve` reserves the assigned DOI with Datacite (will need to be run on every id reported by the the first API). 

Scripted, the whole process would look as follows (adjust as needed)::

   API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
   
   curl -H "X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/pids/unreserved |
   # the API outputs JSON; note the use of jq to parse it:
   jq '.data.count[].pid' | tr -d '"' | 
   while read doi
   do
      curl -H "X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve?persistentId=$doi
   done

If you have a large number of unpublished drafts in the database, reserving them one by one may take some time. So if you want to be extra nice to your users, you may warn them ahead of time that some of them may not be able to publish their drafts immediately after the upgrade. 

For example: 

`curl -X PUT -d "Warning: Brief downtime at 5pm" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:StatusMessageHeader`
`curl -X PUT -d "Dataverse will be briefly unavailable during a planned upgrade to v5.0. Please note that some users may not be able to publish their unpublished draft datasets immediately after the upgrade." http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:StatusMessageText`

Going forward, once all these legacy datasets have been taken care of, some newly-created datasets may still end up with unreserved DOIs. (For example, if Datacite service was unavailable at the time of the datast creation; we don't expect it to happen too often, but it is not impossible). To address this preemptively we recommend that you set up a cronjob to run the script above weekly or even nightly.
