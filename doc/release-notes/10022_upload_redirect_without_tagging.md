If your S3 store does not support tagging and gives an error when redirecting uploads, you can disable the tagging by using the ``dataverse.files.<id>.disable-tagging`` JVM option. Disabling the tagging makes it harder to identify abandoned files (created in cases where the user does not complete the upload operation) with an external script but they can still be removed using the [Cleanup Storage of a Dataset](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.13/api/native-api.html#cleanup-storage-of-a-dataset) API endpoint.
