If your S3 store does not support tagging and gives an error when redirecting uploads, from now on, you can disable the tagging by using the ``dataverse.files.<id>.disable-tagging`` JVM option. Disabling the tagging can result in leftover files that are not used by your Dataverse instance and should be removed to preserve the storage space. To clean up the leftover files, you can use the [Cleanup Storage of a Dataset](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.13/api/native-api.html#cleanup-storage-of-a-dataset) API endpoint.
