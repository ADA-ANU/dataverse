## Installation

If this is a new installation, please see our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.6/installation/).

## Upgrade Instructions

0\. These instructions assume that you've already successfully upgraded from Dataverse Software 4.x to Dataverse Software 5 following the instructions in the [Dataverse Software 5 Release Notes](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.0). After upgrading from the 4.x series to 5.0, you should progress through the other 5.x releases before attempting the upgrade to 5.7.

The steps below include a required upgrade to Payara 5.2021.5 or higher. (It is a simple matter of reusing your existing domain directory with the new distribution). But we also recommend that you review the Payara upgrade instructions as it could be helpful during any troubleshooting: [Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2021.5/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)

If you are running Payara as a non-root user (and you should be!), **remember not to execute the commands below as root**. Use `sudo` to change to that user first. For example, `sudo -i -u dataverse` if `dataverse` is your dedicated application user.  

In the following commands we assume that Payara 5 is installed in `/usr/local/payara5`. If not, adjust as needed.

`export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara5`

(or `setenv PAYARA /usr/local/payara5` if you are using a `csh`-like shell)

1\. Undeploy the previous version

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications`
- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse<-version>`

2\. Stop Payara

- `service payara stop`
- `rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`

3\. Move the current Payara directory out of the way

- `mv $PAYARA $PAYARA.MOVED`

4\. Download the new Payara version (5.2021.5+), and unzip it in its place

5\. Replace the brand new payara/glassfish/domains/domain1 with your old, preserved `domain1`

6\. In domain.xml, add/confirm the existence of the following JVM option to/in the `<config name="server-config"><java-config>` section:

`<jvm-options>[1.8.0u251|]-Xbootclasspath/a:${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/grizzly-npn-api.jar</jvm-options>`

7\. Start Payara

- `service payara start`
  
8\. Deploy this version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.6.war`

9\. Restart payara

- `service payara stop`
- `service payara start`
