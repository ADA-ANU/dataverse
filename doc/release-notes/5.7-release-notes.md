# Dataverse Software 5.7

This release brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to the Dataverse Software. Thank you to all of the community members who contributed code, suggestions, bug reports, and other assistance across the project.

## Release Highlights

### Experimental Support for External Vocabulary Services

Dataverse can now be configured to associate specific metadata fields with third-party vocabulary services to provide an easy way for users to select values from those vocabularies. The mapping involves use of external Javascripts. Two such scripts have been developed so far: one for vocabularies served via the [SKOSMOS protocol](https://skosmos.org) and one allowing people to be identified via their [ORCID](https://orcid.org). The guides contain info about the new :CVocConf setting used for configuration and additional information about this functionality. Scripts, examples, and additional documentation are available at the [GDCC GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-external-vocab-support).

Please watch this [online presentation](https://youtu.be/mWMPxCwB2ys?t=1794), [read the document with requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txdcFuxskRx_tLsDQ7KKLFTMR_r9IBhorDu3V_r445w/edit?ts=5fdbca9a) and join [Dataverse Working Group on Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies](https://dataverse.org/community-calls) if you have some questions and want to contribute.

This functionality was initially developed by [Data Archiving and Networked Services](http://dans.knaw.nl/en/) (DANS-KNAW), the Netherlands, and funded by [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu), "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud". SSHOC has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 project call H2020-INFRAEOSC-04-2018, grant agreement #823782. It was further improved by the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) and extended with the support of semantic search.

## Major Use Cases

Newly-supported major use cases in this release include:

- Administrators will be able to set up integrations with external vocabulary services, allowing for autocomplete-assisted metadata entry, metadata standardization, and better integration with other systems. (Issue #7711, PR #7946)
- Users viewing datasets in the root Dataverse collection will now see breadcrumbs that have have a link back to the root Dataverse collection (Issue #7527, PR #8078)
- Users will be able to more easily differentiate between datasets and files through new iconography (Issue #7991, PR #8021)
- Users retrieving large guestbooks over the API will experience fewer failures (Issue #8073, PR #8084)
- (PR #7948)
- (PR #7959)
- (PR 8033)
- (PR 8067)
- (PR 8070)
- (PR 8074)

## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

### Administrators can now be notified when Datasets are created

A new :SendNotificationOnDatasetCreation setting has been added. When true, administrators and curators (those who could publish the dataset) will get an email/notification when a new dataset is created. This makes it easier to track activity in a Dataverse and, for example, allow admins to follow up when users do not publish a new dataset within some period of time.

### Skip checksum validation if over limit when publishing datasets

When a user requests to publish a dataset, the time taken to complete the publishing process varies based on the dataset/datafile size.

With the additional settings of :DatasetChecksumValidationSizeLimit and :DataFileChecksumValidationSizeLimit, the checksum validation can be skipped while publishing.

If the Dataverse admin choose to set these values, its strongly recommended to have an external auditing system runs periodically to monitor the integrity of the files in their Dataverse.

### Update Retrieve Guestbook Response API to remove default output file

With this release the Retrieve Guestbook Responses for a Dataverse Collection will no longer produce a file by default. You may specify an output file by adding a -o $YOURFILENAME to the curl command.

### Dynamic Java Server Faces Configuration Options

This release includes a new way to easily change JSF settings via MicroProfile Config, especially useful during development.
See the [development guide on "Debugging"](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.7/developers/debugging.html).

### Enhancements to DDI Metadata Exports

Several changes have been made to the DDI exports to improve support for internationalization and to improve compliance with CESSDA requirements. These changes include:

- Addition of xml:lang attributes specifying the dataset metadata language at the document level and for individual elements such as title and description
- Specification of controlled vocabulary terms in duplicate elements in multiple languages (in the installation default langauge and, if different, the dataset metadata language)

While these changes are intended to improve harvesting and integration with external systems, the could break existing connections that make assumptions about the elements and attributes that have been changed.

## New JVM Options and DB Settings

:xxx can be xxx

## Notes for Tool Developers and Integrators

### Bag update to support file paths

The original Bag generation code stored all dataset files directly under the /data directory. With the addition in Dataverse of a directory path for files and then a change to allow files with different paths to have the same name, archival Bags will now use the directory path from Dataverse to avoid name collisions within the /data directory. Prior to this update, Bags from Datasets with multiple files with the same name would have been created with only one of the files with that name (with warnings in the log, but still generating the Bag).

## Complete List of Changes

## Installation

If this is a new installation, please see our [Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.6/installation/).

## Upgrade Instructions

0\. These instructions assume that you've already successfully upgraded from Dataverse Software 4.x to Dataverse Software 5 following the instructions in the [Dataverse Software 5 Release Notes](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v5.0). After upgrading from the 4.x series to 5.0, you should progress through the other 5.x releases before attempting the upgrade to 5.7.

The steps below include a required upgrade to Payara 5.2021.5 or higher. (It is a simple matter of reusing your existing domain directory with the new distribution). But we also recommend that you review the Payara upgrade instructions as it could be helpful during any troubleshooting: [Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2021.5/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)

If you are running Payara as a non-root user (and you should be!), **remember not to execute the commands below as root**. Use `sudo` to change to that user first. For example, `sudo -i -u dataverse` if `dataverse` is your dedicated application user.  

In the following commands we assume that Payara 5 is installed in `/usr/local/payara5`. If not, adjust as needed.

`export PAYARA=/usr/local/payara5`

(or `setenv PAYARA /usr/local/payara5` if you are using a `csh`-like shell)

1\. Undeploy the previous version

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin list-applications`
- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin undeploy dataverse<-version>`

2\. Stop Payara

- `service payara stop`
- `rm -rf $PAYARA/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`

3\. Move the current Payara directory out of the way

- `mv $PAYARA $PAYARA.MOVED`

4\. Download the new Payara version (5.2021.5+), and unzip it in its place

5\. Replace the brand new payara/glassfish/domains/domain1 with your old, preserved `domain1`

6\. In domain.xml, add/confirm the existence of the following JVM option to/in the `<config name="server-config"><java-config>` section:

`<jvm-options>[1.8.0u251|]-Xbootclasspath/a:${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/grizzly-npn-api.jar</jvm-options>`

7\. Start Payara

- `service payara start`
  
8\. Deploy this version.

- `$PAYARA/bin/asadmin deploy dataverse-5.6.war`

9\. Restart payara

- `service payara stop`
- `service payara start`
