## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators

###

Idle session timeout for logged-in users has been made configurable in this release. 
The default is now set to 8 hours (this is a change from the previous default value of 24 hours). 
If you want to change it, set the setting :LoginSessionTimeout to the new value *in minutes*. 
For example, to reduce the timeout to 4 hours:                                                                                                                                                                          
 curl -X PUT -d 240 http://localhost:8080/api/admin/settings/:LoginSessionTimeout

Once again, this is the session timeout for *logged-in* users only. For the anonymous sessions the sessions are set to time out after the default ``session-timeout`` value (also in minutes) in the web.xml of the Dataverse application, which is set to 10 minutes. You will most likely not ever need to change this, but if you do, configure it by editing the web.xml file. 

### Flexible Solr Schema

### Upgrading: optionally reconfigure Solr

With this release, we moved all fields in Solr search index that relate to the default metadata schemas from `schema.xml` to separate
files. Custom metadata block configuration of the search index can be more easily automated that way. For details, 
see admin/metadatacustomization.html#updating-the-solr-schema.

This is optional, but all future changes will go to these files. It might be a good idea to reconfigure Solr now or be aware to
look for changes to these files in the future, too. Here's how:

1. You will need to replace or modify your `schema.xml` with the recent one (containing XML includes)
2. Copy `schema_dv_mdb_fields.xml` and `schema_dv_mdb_copies.xml` to the same location as the `schema.xml`
3. A re-index is not necessary as long no other changes happened, as this is only a reorganization of Solr fields from a single schema.xml file into multiple files.

In case you use custom metadata blocks, you might find the new `updateSchemaMDB.sh` script beneficial. Again,
see admin/metadatacustomization.html#updating-the-solr-schema.
