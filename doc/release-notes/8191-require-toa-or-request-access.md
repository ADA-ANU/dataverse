## Terms of Access or Request Access Required for Restricted Files

Beginning in this release, Restricted Files must have either Terms of Access or Request Access enabled. This change is to ensure that for each file in a Dataverse installation there is a clear path to get to the data, either through requesting access to the data or to provide context about why requesting access is not enabled.
