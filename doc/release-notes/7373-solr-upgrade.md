### Solr Update

With this release we upgrade to the latest available stable release in the Solr 8.x branch. We recommend a fresh installation of Solr 8.8.1 (the index will be empty)
followed by an "index all".

Before you start the "index all", Dataverse will appear to be empty because
the search results come from Solr. As indexing progresses, partial results will 
appear until indexing is complete.
