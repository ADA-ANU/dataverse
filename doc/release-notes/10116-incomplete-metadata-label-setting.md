Bug fixed for the ``incomplete metadata`` label being shown for published dataset with incomplete metadata in certain scenarios. This label will now only be shown for draft versions of such datasets. This label can also be made visible for published datasets with the new option ``dataverse.ui.show-validity-label-when-published``, and will be only shown on datasets with incomplete metadata that the logged-in user can edit.
